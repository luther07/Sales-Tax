Sales tax problem.
Assumption: output lines print unit price rather than line total.

Assumption: I can use java.lang.Math, because it is not considered external.

Assumption: The taxes will not be variable.

Assumption: Each well-formed input row should have quantity, followed by description,
followed by "at", followed by pre-tax price. I assume each pare is required. 

To test application: 
From the project base directory type: 'java -jar target/scala-2.9.1/sales-tax_2.9.1-1.0.jar'
Type three full lines of input like:
1 book at 12.49
1 music CD at 14.99
1 chocolate bar at 0.85
